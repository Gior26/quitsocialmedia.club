## Coherence

- *It's incoherent: you are promoting [quitsocialmedia.club](/) **on** social media. If you promote the idea of abandoning social media and you use them to share your perspective, you go against the very idea of quitting them!*   
Not quite so. Think about this: if I love the strawberry flavour of the ice cream, I won't speak about how much strawberries are delicious with a friend who is eating a strawberry ice cream, I'll try to let my friend who is eating a chocolate ice cream taste a spoon of my strawberry one. Similarly, it makes no sense to quit Social Media and share this choice *off* social media: people who may quit are the ones who didn't quit yet, and, guess what, they can be reached by social media exclusively, since there is no other valid alternative.   
This apparently incoherent decision conceals in itself one of the very reasons of quitting: you have no way (or if you do, it's very unlikely) of being noticed or reaching some audience unless it's done through those platforms.
- *If you quit social media, you should quit *all* social media*. Why do you consider only the big platforms?   
Mainly, because the vast majority of the problems derives from the fact that the most famous social media are owned by corporations which make profit by managing unethically their platforms. Strictly speaking, by definition social media are not something which is mainly bad, and as a shorthand it's quicker to consider “Social Media” as “Social Media owned by for-profit companies that make money from activities users do for free”, even if it's not exactly so.

## Name

- *Why <cite>Quit Social Media</cite> and not <cite>Tommi quits Social Media</cite>?*
- *Why the `.club` domain?*

Even if I somewhat already answered these questions in the [About page](/about "About - quitsocialmedia.club"), it's important to specify that I did not want to build a whole website to explain why *I* quit Social Media, or I would've done this on [my personal website](https://tommi.space "tommi.space"); I couldn't find a comprehensive list of [why](/why "Why Quit Social Media") Social Media are bad anywhere on the web: there were articles (which I linked), videos and papers, but they all focused on very few points, never providing the whole picture. Since making this website has been a stressful, long and intense work, I believe it's not about me or my personal reasons for quitting, but it extensively covers all of the possible negative arguments which would make someone quit.\
I chose the `.club` domain because it was among the cheapest and it also makes sense: [as I pointed out](/about "About - quitsocialmedia.club"), quitting Social Media alone is not a deeply meaningful action.

## Why

- *Why did you spend all of this time and effort creating this website?*
- *Is someone paying you?*
- *What's your gain in all of this?*

I have absolutely **no personal gain** in creating this website and in spamming it everywhere. On the contrary, I invested so much time in writhing these words and building this virtual place (I’m not a developer) that I became very tired and stressed and I came close to giving up. Few months ago, I was so sleepy that by mistake I deleted the working directory of this website, irremediably losing months of hard work.\

## Expectations

- *Once the website will be completed, what will you do?*
- *Why should I share this website?*
- *What do you expect it happens?*
- *Do you want everybody in the world to quit Social Media?*

I don’t expect for this website to become viral, but, deep inside me, I strongly hope so. Please help me by [sharing this](/share "Share")!
