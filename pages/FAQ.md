## Name

- *Why *Quit Social Media* and not *Tommi quits Social Media*?*
- *Why the `.club` domain?*

Even if I somewhat already answered these questions in the [About page](/about "About - quitsocialmedia.club"), it's important to specify that I did not want to build a whole website to explain why *I* quit Social Media, or I would've done this on [my personal website](https://tommi.space "tommi.space"); I couldn't find a comprehensive list of [why](/why "Why Quit Social Media") Social Media are bad anywhere on the web: there were articles (which I linked), videos and papers, but they all focused on very few points, never providing the whole picture. Since making this website has been a stressful, long and intense work, I believe it's not about me or my personal reasons for quitting, but it extensively covers all of the possible negative arguments which would make someone quit.\
I chose the `.club` domain because it was among the cheapest and it also makes sense: [as I pointed out](/about "About - quitsocialmedia.club"), quitting Social Media alone is not a deeply meaningful action.

## Why

- *Why did you spend all of this time and effort creating this website?*
- *Is someone paying you?*
- *What's your gain in all of this?*

I have absolutely **no personal gain** in creating this website and in spamming it everywhere. On the contrary, I invested so much time in writhing these words and building this virtual place (I’m not a developer) that I became very tired and stressed and I came close to giving up. Few months ago, I was so sleepy that by mistake I deleted the working directory of this website, irremediably losing months of hard work.\
If you appreciate what I did, please [consider contributing](/contribute "Contribute")

## Expectations

- *Once the website will be completed, what will you do?*
- *Why should I share this website?*
- *What do you expect it happens?*
- *Do you want everybody in the world to quit Social Media?*

I don’t expect for this website to become viral, but, deep inside me, I strongly hope so. Please help me by [sharing this](/share "Share")!
