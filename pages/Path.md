You should not rush it (and very likely you don't even want to): don't delete any account straight away.\
Before you get there, *if* you do, there's an awareness path to follow.

<div class="blue box">
	Since you can take action at different levels, actions which get you closer to <a href="https://tommi.space/internet-freedom" target="_blank" title="“Internet Freedom” in Tommi's notes">Internet Freedom</a> are gameified and displayed as levels, from <a href="/l00">Level 0</a> to <a href="/l1000">Level 1000</a>.
</div>

<br>

- **Level 0**: Find out more [about](/about "About quitsocialmedia.club") this website and [its purpose](/about#purpose "Purpose - quitsocialmedia.club")
- **Level 1**: understand [why](/why "Why") you should quit Social Media
- **Level 2**: go through [more resources](/links "Links") and deepen your knowledge, also by [watching videos](/watch "Watch") and [listening to podcasts](/listen "Listen").
- **Level 3**: try **Taking control** by first taking some [intermediate steps](https://www.humanetech.com/take-control "Take Control - Humane Center of Technology")
- **Level 4**: before doing something you may regret, try to <u>deactivate your accounts</u> for some time. Start with a week off, then a month, then the whole summer, and eventually consider testing your endurance for one whole year. If you are satisfied, you may proceed to the next level.
- **Level 5**: [delete](/delete "Delete") your Social Media accounts
- **Level 1000**: [Contribute](/contribute "Contribute") to this website
