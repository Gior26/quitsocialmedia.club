After a few tormented months thinkering about the ups and downs of social media, [Tommi](https://tommi.space) couldn’t stand it anymore. He was so stressed and obsessed about ethical issues today’s networks have, he figured out **quitting** was the only way to feel better.

He figured out, though, that just quitting and taking no more action was useless. How many people around the world have his same toughts and concerns? How can he share with all his frend and people around him in the best possible way the crucial importance of doubting about the use of social media platforms?

Simply abandoning social media platforms change nothing.

Let’s be honest: having no account on Facebook, Instagram, nor Twitter today could easily seem as being left out of social relations and live in a quiet but isolated bubble. If you£re not alone, it’s not.

This website has three main purposes:

- Listing in a unique place all of the articles, researches, documentaries, interviews, material, etc. which proves how the risks and damages of social media outweight their (still great) vantages.
- Being a reference point for all social media quitters, fostering and uniting a growing global community.
- Allowing skeptical and indifferent social media users to understand how individual and personal choiches are crucial and fundamental to improve online experience and making the internet a better place.

Tommi is aware of all the great and awesome communities which promote internet freedom and social media corporations independence, but he feels that there’s a critical aknowledgement which isn’t stressed out enough: **the single individual is the key to global change**. We should’t wait for policies and laws to be rolled out, or we can’t believe someone else will come and make everything better, someday.

We need to understand, read, be informed and study what’s happening.

Then, unite together, stand out and be the change.

## Notes

- I chose the `.club` domain because it was among the cheapest and, in the end, it makes sense.
- I want to point out I have absolutely no personal gain in doing this website and spamming it everywhere. On the contrary, I invested so much time in writhing these words and building this virtual place (I’m not a developer) I became so tired and stressed I came close to giving up several times. (Once, I was so tired that by mistake I deleted the working directory of this website, irremediably losing months of hard work)
- I don’t expect for this website to become viral, but, deep inside me, I strongly hope so.
- I don’t want to force you to quit social media, nor I want to convince you it’s the best thing to do. I want anybody who arrives here to read carefully the wabsite’s content and the referenced material, to acquire enough knowledge to decide what’s the best thing to do.
